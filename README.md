# Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior in the telecommunications sector using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Churn, or customer attrition, is a critical business metric that reflects the number of customers who stop using a service within a given period. The objective of this analysis is to understand the key factors driving customer churn and to build accurate machine learning models that can predict which customers are likely to leave the company.

Through comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling (including Logistic Regression and tuned XGBoost), the project identifies high-impact variables and provides strategic recommendations to minimize churn. The insights derived from this analysis can help Telco businesses improve customer retention, optimize marketing strategies, and increase overall profitability.
